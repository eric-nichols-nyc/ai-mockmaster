## AI Integration

AI MockMaster leverages OpenAI's powerful AI models to enhance the interview simulation experience. The integration is primarily handled in the `src/app/api/[[...route]]/openai.ts` file. Here's an overview of how AI is utilized in the project:

1. **Interview Question Generation**
   The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate relevant interview questions based on the job title, description, and required skills. This ensures that each mock interview is tailored to the specific job the user is preparing for.

   ```typescript
   app.post('/generate-questions', async (c) => {
     // ... request parsing ...

     const prompt = `Generate 5 interview questions based on the following information:
     Title: ${jobTitle}
     Description: ${jobDescription}
     Required Skills: ${skills}
     
     Provide the questions in the following JSON format:
     {
       "questions": [
         {
           "question": "Question text here"
         },
         ...
       ]
     }
     
     Ensure the questions are relevant to the provided information and cover a range of topics suitable for the position.`

     const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
       model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
       messages: [
         { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant that generates interview questions." },
         { role: "user", content: prompt }
       ],
       temperature: 0.7,
     })

     // ... response handling ...
   })
   ```

2. **Text-to-Speech Functionality**
   The application uses OpenAI's text-to-speech model to convert generated questions into audio, providing a more realistic interview experience.

   ```typescript
   app.post('/text-to-speech', async (c) => {
     // ... request parsing ...

     const mp3 = await openai.audio.speech.create({
       model: "tts-1",
       voice: "onyx",
       input: text,
     })

     // ... audio file handling ...
   })
   ```

These AI integrations enable AI MockMaster to:
- Generate contextually relevant interview questions based on specific job details.
- Provide audio versions of the questions, simulating a real interviewer's voice.

To further enhance the AI capabilities, consider:
- Implementing AI-driven feedback on user responses.
- Using AI to analyze speech patterns and provide communication tips.
- Integrating sentiment analysis to gauge the confidence and clarity of responses.

Note: Ensure that you comply with OpenAI's usage policies and implement proper error handling and rate limiting when using these AI services.
